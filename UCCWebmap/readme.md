# A Long Day in Cork Ireland
#### This map shows off a particular friday which some of the friends I had made while studying at University Colegge Cork in Ireland.
##### We walked around a majority of the city center stopping at a cafe, a pub, and a market. We ended the night by walking up Patrick's hill to a small park called Bell's Hill to look over the city during sunset. 
##### It is safe to say I was rather exhausted by the end of the day and took the bus back to my dorm instead of walking the extra few kilometers.
